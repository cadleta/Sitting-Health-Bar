# Sitting-Health-Bar

If you want to download the health bar and try it out for yourself just download and extract the .zip folder.

Then just run the setup and you should be good to go. I'll update this program eventually, just don't expect anything soon.

This program is purely for fun and not for profit, Feel free to edit it as you would like, but don't ask me to fix anything. Also don't get me in trouble with Minecraft.
