# Sitting-Health-Bar

If you want to download the health bar and try it out for yourself just press the green Code button in the top right and select "download .zip"

Then extract the .zip folder and run the setup.exe.

This program is purely for fun and not for profit, Feel free to edit it as you would like, but don't ask me to fix anything. Also don't get me in trouble with Minecraft.
